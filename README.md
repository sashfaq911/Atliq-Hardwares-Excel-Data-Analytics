# Atliq Hardware Data Analytics in Excel 📊🖱️
Welcome to my first Excel project in Data Analysis on Atliq Hardware! This repository showcases the work I’ve completed to analyze sales and financial data for Atliq Hardware, a leading company in the electronic hardware industry. The goal of this project was to generate insightful reports that can help in making informed business decisions to boost sales, improve profit margins, and align financial planning with strategic goals.


## Project Overview 🚀

The primary objective of this project was to create two critical reports:
 

  **1. Sales Report** - Analyzing the sales activities and performance across different regions and product categories.

  **2. Financial Report** - Evaluating the financial health and profitability of AtliQ Hardware.
  
These reports were designed to assist stakeholders in making data-driven decisions to optimize business operations.

## Data Source 🔍

The data used in this project was provided as part of the project instructions and included detailed sales and financial information for AtliQ Hardware. The dataset included over half a million records of sales data and was structured in multiple Excel sheets, encompassing various aspects of the business operations.


## Tools & Techniques 🛠️

 - **Microsoft Excel:** The primary tool used for data analysis, visualization, and reporting.
 - **Pivot Tables & Power Query:** Utilized for summarizing and visualizing data.
 - **Conditional Formatting:** Applied to highlight key data points and trends.
 - **Formulas and Functions:** Leveraged advanced Excel functions such as `SUMIF`, `VLOOKUP`, `IFERROR`, and others to perform complex calculations.

## Data Cleaning/ Preparation 🕵️‍♀️
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks: 

### 🧹 Data Cleaning: 

Ensured that the data was accurate, complete, and ready for analysis.
 - No missing values
 - No errors/ #na in columns
 - No spelling mistakes
 - All dim tables contain a unique column

### 🔧 Data Transformation:

 - Structured the data to facilitate easier analysis using Power Query.
 - Merged data using Left Join between tables.
 - Created new columns using DAX measures for calculated fields.


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 👩🏻‍💻

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions for the following reports: 

### 📈 Sales Report:
 -  Create a _[Customer Performance Report](https://github.com/sashfaq911/Atliq-Hardwares-Excel-Data-Analytics/blob/Projects/Sales%20Analytics/Customer%20Performance%20Report.pdf)_ to show the net sales of individual customers for the year 2019- 2021 and as well as a comparison of year 2021 and 2020.
 -  Conduct a comprehensive comparison between _[market (countries) performance and sales target](https://github.com/sashfaq911/Atliq-Hardwares-Excel-Data-Analytics/blob/Projects/Sales%20Analytics/Market%20Performance%20vs%20Target%20Report.pdf)_ for 2019-2021.
 -  Find the top _[10 products based on the percentage increase](https://github.com/sashfaq911/Atliq-Hardwares-Excel-Data-Analytics/blob/Projects/Sales%20Analytics/Top%2010%20Products.pdf)_ in their net sales from 2020 to 2021?
 -  Generate a _["Division"](https://github.com/sashfaq911/Atliq-Hardwares-Excel-Data-Analytics/blob/Projects/Sales%20Analytics/Division%20Level%20Report.pdf)_ report to present the net sales data for 2020 and 2021, along with the growth percentage.
 -  Create a report that ranks the _[top 5 and bottom 5 products](https://github.com/sashfaq911/Atliq-Hardwares-Excel-Data-Analytics/blob/Projects/Sales%20Analytics/Top%20%26%20Bottom%205%20Products.pdf)_ in terms of quantity sold.
 -  What are the _[new products](https://github.com/sashfaq911/Atliq-Hardwares-Excel-Data-Analytics/blob/Projects/Sales%20Analytics/New%20Products%202021.pdf)_ that AtliQ began selling in 2021?
 -  What are the _[top 5 countries](https://github.com/sashfaq911/Atliq-Hardwares-Excel-Data-Analytics/blob/Projects/Sales%20Analytics/Top%205%20Country%202021.pdf)_ in terms of net sales in 2021?

### 🏦 Finance Report:
 -  Create Profit and Loss (P&L) reports by _[Fiscal Year](https://github.com/sashfaq911/Atliq-Hardwares-Excel-Data-Analytics/blob/Projects/Finance%20Analytics/P%26L%20Statement%20By%20Fiscal%20Year.pdf)_ & _[Months](https://github.com/sashfaq911/Atliq-Hardwares-Excel-Data-Analytics/blob/Projects/Finance%20Analytics/P%26L%20Statement%20by%20Months%20.pdf)_
 -  Create a Profit and Loss (P&L) report by _[Markets](https://github.com/sashfaq911/Atliq-Hardwares-Excel-Data-Analytics/blob/Projects/Finance%20Analytics/P%26L%20Statement%20by%20Markets.pdf)_
 -  Create a _[GM% by Quarters](https://github.com/sashfaq911/Atliq-Hardwares-Excel-Data-Analytics/blob/Projects/Finance%20Analytics/GM%25%20by%20Quarters%20(sub%20zone).pdf)_ report in the sub zone division for each of the years from 2019-2021.
